<<Sample Program SCAN>>

  This sample program is contained as an example for using LibTchWaitScan(), a library
 added for add-in programs. The ball displayed on the screen moves only when you touch
 the arrow marked button at the bottom of the screen.

  Using this enables you to acquire touch information without waiting for a touch,
 which was impossible with previous PV's.

  For details about how to use the library, refer to the manual and the sample program.
