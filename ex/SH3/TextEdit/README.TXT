<<Sample Program TextEdit>>

  This sample program is a simple text editor that is contained as an example for using
 LibUbf*(), a library added for add-in programs.

  Using this enables you to handle user data files inside PV as consecutive binary
 files, which are common to PC's.
  With this library, you can access general data (except for PVA or AID files) that
  can be input from or output to PC's using FTM.

 For details about how to use the library, refer to the manual and the sample program.
