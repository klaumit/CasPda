 :


1) The directories for the respective modes are placed under the "C" directory. Thus the 
  compilation and link operation can be complete in each directory.

2) The directory structure for each mode is described below.  You can create the HEX files 
  for the compiling, linking and updating operation by executing "MK.BAT" available for 
  each mode.

<SAMPLE>
 |MK.BAT	A batch file for compiling or linking.
 |MAKEFILE	Information file for Make command.
 |ForDEBUG.MAP	Map files (Symbol files for the simulator.)
 |
 +------<C>		C source file group
 +------<H>		Header file group
 +------<MENUICON>	Icon graphics for menu
 +------<ForDEBUG>	Compiling objects for the simulator
 +------<OBJ>		Compiling objects


3) The settings of "LINK2S.DAT" and "LINK2P.DAT" located in the directory "COM_LNK" 
  expect that the installation directory of LSIC86 is "C:\LSIJ\LSIC86pv".

4) The settings of PV simulator project expect that the installation directory path of this 
  environment is "C:\CASIO\PV2xxx".

5) If the installation directory path for this environment is not "C:\CASIO\PV2xxx", and LSIC86 
  is not installed in "C:\LSIJ\LSIC86pv", you need to update following files:

  'xxx' is model name of SDK.

 	<CASIO\PV2xxx>
 		PATHSET.BAT
 		<C\COM_LNK>
 			LINK2S.DAT
 			LINK2P.DAT
 		<SIM>
 			PVxxx.CPJ
 			PVxxx.CPJ
 	<LSIJ\LSIC86pv>
 		<BIN>
 			_LCC86
