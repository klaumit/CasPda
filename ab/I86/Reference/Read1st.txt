	However, since the database co-exits with the user data, it is recommended to make the maximum database capacity be about 1MB.

	PV-250X/750/S250		Approx. 1.5MB of user data area
	PV-450X/S450		Approx. 3.4MB of user data area
 	Recommended maximum capacity of database	Approx. 1MB

Å@2)Outline of Procedure for Creation

	Prepare a text file in accordance with the format (DataFormatV100.TXT) for database.
		|	To create a database newly, use this database format.
		|	If you already have a database with different format, it is necessary to
		|	create software to convert that format to this database format. 
		|	(Refer to $ 6.)
		|
	Convert a text file to the format to be read by PV by using the database conversion tool (MKDB.EXE).
	At this time, an index table for each header is added to the end of the converted file.
		|
	Transfer the converted file to PV by using the database transfer tool (PVSENDER.EXE, datarec.bin).
		|
	Create a backup of the database by using PVM.

	* Displays the contents of the linked destination by a touch of the linked string.


$3. Notes

  1) Limitation on the size of the database
	* The upper limit depends on the volume of registered user data.
	* It is necessary to reorganize the memory before putting the database into PV.

  2) Notes on formatting
	* Make sure that the database format is in accordance with the one in "DataFormatV100.TXT".
	  If your database is not in accordance with this format, it is necessary to create new add-in software.
	  In that case, note the followings:
		Be sure to include a judgement process to distinguish from other database.
		  To be recognized as the database for the add-in software to be created, identification information should be included in the database.
		Create the database with divided registration in mind.
		  It is necessary to consider the structure of the database for the dividing unit.

  3) Note on database-creating tool
	* This tool does not compress the database.

  4) Referencing add-in software for samples (Referencer)
	* This software deals with only the data converted from the TEXT file in accordance with the format provided by using the dedicated database-creating tool and registered to PV by the dedicated transfer tool.
	* This software offers no general-purpose interface nor search engine.

$5. Procedure for Creating Database

This section describes the procedure for creating the database by using "Sample" as an example.
Refer to each manual in the <DOC> folder for details on each tool.


 1) Prepare a text file in accordance with the format for the database.
	The text file to be prepared here should be created by following the rules described in 
 "DataFormatV100.TXT".
	To create a file, use a text editor and other software.

	In "Sample2", you will find the file "SDK_Lib.TXT". 

 2) Convert the file to the format usable by the add-in software Referencer.
 	To convert, start "MKDB.EXE" and select the file prepared in the step 1).
	In the file after conversion, the name of the file will be the original file name with ".DIC" extension.
	If an error occurs during conversion, information is output to a log file with the original file name plus ".LOG" extension.
	When an error occurs, check the contents of the file "DataFormatV100.TXT" and modify the text file.

	In "Sample2", 
		"SDK_Lib.DIC" is created from "SDK_Lib.TXT" by using "MKDB.EXE".
		The file "SDK_Lib.LOG" has an output "COMPLETE!!" which means normal completion.

 3) Transfer the converted file to PV.
	Connect PV with PC by using the cradle cable.
 	Register the add-in software "datarec.bin" to PV by using "PVM.EXE".
	Start "PVSENDER.EXE" and select ".DIC" files.
	In "REGISTRATION FILE NAME" of "PVSENDER", specify the file name of the database on PV.
	Click "SEND" of "PVSENDER"ÇÃ"SEND" to display the message window for confirmation.
	Click [OK] to let the software wait for transfer.
	Tap the icon for "Data-Recorder" displayed in the menu of PV and start it.
	Transfer starts.

	In "Sample2",
		Start "PVSENDER.EXE" and select "SDK_Lib.DIC".
		In "REGISTRATION FILE NAME", "DbSdkLib0100en" is already shown.
		Transfer as it is.

 4) Perform backup of the database by using "PVM"
	Perform backup the database registered to PV by using "PVM.EXE".
	Click [Excute]-[Import form PV] of "PVM".
	Tap [Menu][MenuBar] of "PVM" and select [Download].
	After a while, the file name of the database specified by "PVSENDER" within "Data List" on "PVM". 
	Select that database, click the right mouse button, and then click [Backup].
	Specify the folder to be stored with the file name and click [OK]. Backup of the data starts.
	The extension of the file name is ".ADT" by default. Use the default extension when saving.

	In "Sample2",
		In "Data List" of "PVM", "DbSdkLib0100en" is displayed.
		The file name after backup is "SDK_Lib.ADT".

	<IMPORTANT>
	By using the file (.ADT) backed up here, registration of the database to "PV" can be done only by "PVM.EXE".

 5) Register the add-in software "Referencer" to PV.
	By using "PVM.EXE", register "Referencer.BIN" to PV.
	After registration, refer to the database by starting "Referencer" from the menu screen of PV.

	<CAUTION>
	The name of the database displayed in "Referencer" is the one set by "@\DN" in the text file.

	In "Sample", "SDK LibDoc" is displayed when "Referencer" is started.

 6) Confirm the database.
 	By using "Referencer", check if the contents of the created database is correct or not.
	If any error is found, correct the mistakes in the text file and start from the step 2).


$6. About Development of New add-in Software (PV Application)

The database which is not in accordance with "DataFormatV100.TXT" cannot be used in  "Referencer".
If you prefer to create a database in a different format, it is necessary to develop new add-in software.
In this case, some tools provided in this development kit cannot be used.

	(To debug the add-in software)
	Perform backup of the user data by using PCSync.
		|
	Convert the above backup file to the format to be read by a simulator by using the backup converter (BPKC.EXE).
		|
	Read the above file to the simulator (SIM3022.EXE) and perform debugging.

 1) Software which cannot be used to develop new add-in software
	PC-side software: MKDB.EXE,PVSENDER.EXE
	PV Application software:  Referencer.bin

 2) Software which can be used to develop new add-in software
	PC-side software: PVS_dev.EXE,BKPC.EXE,PVM.EXE
	PV Application software: datarec.bin

 3) Notes on developing new software

	* About division of files
		In order for the files on PC to be used in PV, it is necessary to divide the file into the data unit for PV.
		The tool to divide the file automatically and to transfer it to PV is "PVS_dev.EXE".
		(Up to 30KB with 1KB increment can be specified as the division unit for  "PVS_dev.EXE".)
		In addition, the add-in software which registers the data transferred by "PVS_dev.EXE" is "datarec.bin".)

		When creating new add-in software, consider referencing the database by this division unit.
		In addition, it is necessary to create the database with access of the data by this division unit in mind.
		Further, it is necessary to determine the division unit with the RAM area of PV used for the add-in software.
		For the RAM area used for the add-in software, refer to "MEMMAP.TXT" provided with SDK.
		(ReferenceÅF The division unit in "Referencer" is 10KB.)

	* Treatment of database
		In PV, there are data for other add-in software also.
		Create the database so that the data for it and the one for the newly-developed add-in database are distinguishable.

	* Debugging with the simulator
		3-1) By using PVM.EXE, register "datarec.bin" to PV.
		3-2) Register the database created by using "PVS_dev.EXE" and "datarec.bin" (Data-Recorder).
		3-3) Back up the PV's data on PC by backup communication of PCSync software. (.BKP file is created.)
		3-4) By using "BKPC.EXE", convert the backed-up file (.BKP) to the format to be used in the simulator.
		3-5) Read the add-in software developed and the file converted in the step 3-4) into the simulator (SIM3022.EXE).
		3-6) Debug the add-in software on the simulator.

	* About difference between "PVS_dev.EXE" and "PVSENDER.EXE"
		Since the newly-developed add-in software has the structure which is dependent on the division unit of the file, it is necessary to avoid modification of the division unit when distributing to users who create only the database.
		Therefore, "PVSENDER.EXE" is used to fix the division unit to the value described in the configuration file.
		If the configuration file "PVSCFG.INI" for "PVS_dev.EXE" is copied under the same directory as "PVSENDER.EXE", the same configuration used in "PVS_dev.EXE" applies at the next startup of "PVSENDER.EXE".
		Note: This operation disables "Referencer".


	 * Copy from "RefSource" directory to "PVSDK"
		Please use the Referencer C Source file group as a sample of new add-in software development.
