<Format of TEXT Data>							Ver. 1.00
	ÅEThe TEXT data defined here is generated as the database by using the lexicalization tool.
	ÅEIn the lexicalization tool, the entry word is sorted by code. (However, alphabetical order applies to A-Z and a-z.)
	ÅEOne unit of data (from @\TTITLE to @\T) shall be 10KB maximum.
	ÅEOne unit of line shall be 9 dots vertically (including 1 dot of inter-line space). (That is, the scrolling unit shall be 9 dots vertically.)
	ÅE@\x, @\g, @\f, and @\l(lower-case "L") can be used in the statement.
	ÅEThe object of search shall be @\TTITLE only.

	3) Only @\x and @\f can be specified in the string of TITLE.
	4) In the end of the "@\T" definition, the line feed is always necessary.

	@\TTITLE+CRLF	Entry word (to be an object for search)
			The string from @\T to the line break is regarded as one string of TITLE.

	End of main body 	The next "@\TTITLE" and "@\LLinkTITLE" is regarded as end.

$3.Main Body of Text
	1) The main body is the range from @\TTITLE to @\T.
	2) Various specifications beginning with @\ is possible within the main body.
	3) The strings in the main body are not the object of search.
	4) In the end of the "@\C" definition, the line feed is always necessary.

	Main body		TEXT data (from 20h to 7Fh)
			where TAB, CR, and CR+LF in the text is processed as it is.
			TAB is converted to SPC. CR+LF is converted to CR.

	@\x??		Single-byte code (this is used to represent the character codes over 80h)
			Codes below 0Fh cannot be specified.
		??= 2-digit HEX 

	@\CCROSSHEAD+CRLF	Sub-header (not the object of search)
			The length of CROSSHEAD is up to 64 characters (excluding @\f specification).

$4.Graphic Specification
	1) This is used to embed the graphics in the main body.
	2) @\g and @\G has different defining function. Be careful of the case-sensitivity!
	3) Graphics is up to 160 dots of X size and 160 dots of Y size.
	4) In the end of the "@\G{}" definition, the line feed is always necessary.

	@\g????		Graphic code

	@\G????{Xsize,Ysize,0x?? , 0x?? , ..}+CRLF	Graphic data
			This defines the body of the graphics which is the code of @\g????.
			In the strings enclosed with "{" and "}", SPACE, CR+LF, CR, and TAB are regarded as WhiteSpace.

		????= 4-digit HEX, ??= 2-digit HEX, Xsize=1-160(in decimal notation), Ysize=1-160(in decimal notation)

$5.Font Specification
	1) This specifies the font for display.
	2) The font specification beginning with @\f is valid until the font is newly specified.

	@\fPB		Specifies proportional boldface font
	@\fPN		Specifies proportional normal font
	@\fNM		Specifies normal (5*7) font

$6.Link Specification
	1) The length of LinkTITLE is up to 64 characters (excluding @\f specification).
	2) @\l and @\L has different defining function. Be careful of the case-sensitivity!

	4) Only @\x and @\f can be specified in the string of LinkTITLE.
	5) LinkTITLE is not the object of search by the regular character input.
	6) If '[' or ']' is included in LinkTITLE, use '@\[' or '@\]'.
	7) @\T and @\L must not be included between @\L[LinkTITLE] and the following @\L.
	8) @\l and @\j must not be included between @\L[LinkTITLE] and the following @\L. (Prohibition of nesting links)
	9) The string between @\L[LinkTITLE] and the following @\L is regarded as the data for link extracted from the main body of text.
	10) In the line with @\L[LinkTITLE], the portion after ']' to the line break is ignored.
	11) In the end of the "@\L" definition, the line feed is always necessary.


	@\l[LinkTITLE]	The string within [ ] is displayed on screen and if tapped, the contents of the link destination is displayed.

	@\L[LinkTITLE]+CRLF	Instructs the start of main body of the original link.
	End of link body 	The next "@\TTITLE" and "@\LLinkTITLE" is regarded as end.

$7.Jump Specification
	1) TITLE must be defined as a header.
	2) The following characters cannot be used: '*', '?', 00h-1Fh, E8h-EFh, F8h-FFh.
