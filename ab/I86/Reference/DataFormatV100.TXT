<Format of TEXT Data>							Ver. 1.00
	・The TEXT data defined here is generated as the database by using the lexicalization tool.
	・In the lexicalization tool, the entry word is sorted by code. (However, alphabetical order applies to A-Z and a-z.)
	・One unit of data (from @\TTITLE to @\T) shall be 10KB maximum.
	・One unit of line shall be 9 dots vertically (including 1 dot of inter-line space). (That is, the scrolling unit shall be 9 dots vertically.)
	・@\x, @\g, @\f, and @\l(lower-case "L") can be used in the statement.
	・The object of search shall be @\TTITLE only.

$1.Database Name and Version
	1) The character length of the database name is up to 15 characters.
	2) The characters usable for the database name are in the range of 20h-7Fh, 80h-E8h, and F0h-F7h.
	3) Only @\x can be specified within the string of the database name.
	4) Be sure to specify the database name and version at the beginning of the file (only once).
	5) The version can specify only a 4 digit figure.
	6) In the end of the "@\DN" definition, the line feed is always necessary.
	7) In the end of the "@\DV" definition, the line feed is always necessary.

	@\DNname+CRLF		Database name

	3) Only @\x and @\f can be specified in the string of TITLE.
	4) In the end of the "@\T" definition, the line feed is always necessary.

	@\TTITLE+CRLF	Entry word (to be an object for search)
			The string from @\T to the line break is regarded as one string of TITLE.

	End of main body 	The next "@\TTITLE" and "@\LLinkTITLE" is regarded as end.

$3.Main Body of Text
	1) The main body is the range from @\TTITLE to @\T.
	2) Various specifications beginning with @\ is possible within the main body.
	3) The strings in the main body are not the object of search.
	4) In the end of the "@\C" definition, the line feed is always necessary.

	Main body		TEXT data (from 20h to 7Fh)
			where TAB, CR, and CR+LF in the text is processed as it is.
			TAB is converted to SPC. CR+LF is converted to CR.

	@\x??		Single-byte code (this is used to represent the character codes over 80h)
			Codes below 0Fh cannot be specified.
		??= 2-digit HEX 

	@\CCROSSHEAD+CRLF	Sub-header (not the object of search)
			The length of CROSSHEAD is up to 64 characters (excluding @\f specification).
			The following characters cannot be used: '*', '?', 00h-1Fh, E8h-EFh, F8h-FFh.
			Only @\x and @\f can be specified in the string of CROSSHEAD.
			The string from @\C to the line break is regarded as one string of CROSSHEAD.


$4.Graphic Specification
	1) This is used to embed the graphics in the main body.
	2) @\g and @\G has different defining function. Be careful of the case-sensitivity!
	3) Graphics is up to 160 dots of X size and 160 dots of Y size.
	4) In the end of the "@\G{}" definition, the line feed is always necessary.

	@\g????		Graphic code
			The position specified by this is the plotting start position of the graphics. The part drawing outside the screen is not displayed.

	@\G????{Xsize,Ysize,0x?? , 0x?? , ..}+CRLF	Graphic data
			This defines the body of the graphics which is the code of @\g????.
			In the strings enclosed with "{" and "}", SPACE, CR+LF, CR, and TAB are regarded as WhiteSpace.

		????= 4-digit HEX, ??= 2-digit HEX, Xsize=1-160(in decimal notation), Ysize=1-160(in decimal notation)

$5.Font Specification
	1) This specifies the font for display.
	2) The font specification beginning with @\f is valid until the font is newly specified.

	@\fPB		Specifies proportional boldface font
	@\fPN		Specifies proportional normal font
	@\fNM		Specifies normal (5*7) font

$6.Link Specification
	1) The length of LinkTITLE is up to 64 characters (excluding @\f specification).
	2) @\l and @\L has different defining function. Be careful of the case-sensitivity!
	3) The following characters cannot be used: '*', '?', 00h-1Fh, E8h-EFh, F8h-FFh.
	4) Only @\x and @\f can be specified in the string of LinkTITLE.
	5) LinkTITLE is not the object of search by the regular character input.
	6) If '[' or ']' is included in LinkTITLE, use '@\[' or '@\]'.
	7) @\T and @\L must not be included between @\L[LinkTITLE] and the following @\L.
	8) @\l and @\j must not be included between @\L[LinkTITLE] and the following @\L. (Prohibition of nesting links)
	9) The string between @\L[LinkTITLE] and the following @\L is regarded as the data for link extracted from the main body of text.
	10) In the line with @\L[LinkTITLE], the portion after ']' to the line break is ignored.
	11) In the end of the "@\L" definition, the line feed is always necessary.


	@\l[LinkTITLE]	The string within [ ] is displayed on screen and if tapped, the contents of the link destination is displayed.

	@\L[LinkTITLE]+CRLF	Instructs the start of main body of the original link.
	End of link body 	The next "@\TTITLE" and "@\LLinkTITLE" is regarded as end.

$7.Jump Specification
	1) TITLE must be defined as a header.
	2) The following characters cannot be used: '*', '?', 00h-1Fh, E8h-EFh, F8h-FFh.
